/**
 * ActionsDrawer is a component used in the content manager edit view page and content history page.
 * It's a sticky banner that can expand to reveal more actions. It's used only in mobile and tablet.
 *
 * A similar component is currently in development in the design-system but it's not ready yet.
 * Using the Panels for the edit view page brought some complexity and for the moment, we decided to go with this custom implementation.
 *
 * @TODO: Replace this component with the one in the design-system when it's ready.
